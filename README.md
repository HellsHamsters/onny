## What is Onny?

Onny it is a music player providing availability to sound songs 
from popular russian social network [VK](https://vk.com) directly 
in OS X like iTunes.

Simply put it is a bridge between music player from [VK](https://vk.com) 
and media controls in OS X.

Currently it is an experiment with wrapping the website in Electron. 
But, we hope that in future it will be more than research about how to 
forward website's functionality to regular native OS places.
